# Networking Infrastructure Setup with Pulumi and AWS

This repository provides Pulumi code to set up networking infrastructure on AWS, including the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, internet gateway, and route tables. The code is written in a high-level language (e.g., Python, TypeScript) to create AWS resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI. You can find instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

2. **Pulumi CLI**: Install Pulumi CLI by following the instructions [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iac-pulumi.git
   cd iac-pulumi
   ```

2. **Initialize Pulumi Project**:

   Choose your preferred language (e.g., JavaScript or Python), and initialize the Pulumi project:

   - Javascript:

     ```bash
     pulumi new javascript
     ```

   - Python:

     ```bash
     pulumi new python
     ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your Pulumi project.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install any required dependencies using the package manager associated with your chosen language (npm for Javascript, pip for Python).

   - Javascript:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Python:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Deploying the Infrastructure

Run the following command to deploy the networking infrastructure on AWS:

```bash
pulumi up
```

Follow the prompts to confirm and proceed with the deployment.

## Cleaning Up

To destroy the created resources and clean up the infrastructure:

```bash
pulumi destroy
```

Follow the prompts to confirm and proceed with the destruction.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Pulumi code according to your specific requirements. Adjust the number of subnets, availability zones, and other parameters as needed.

## Note

This README provides a basic guide for setting up networking infrastructure on AWS using Pulumi. Be sure to review and adapt the Pulumi code to meet your specific use case and security requirements.
